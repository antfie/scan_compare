# Veracode Scan Compare üîç

This functionality has been merged into the [scan_health](https://github.com/veracode/scan_health) tool. As such this repository is no longer needed. Scan Health is the one-stop app for scan health and compare enquiries.


Scans can be compared like so:

```bash
./scan_health -action compare -a https://analysiscenter.veracode.com/auth/index.jsp#... -b https://analysiscenter.veracode.com/auth/index.jsp#...
```
